# Cpp_codes
This repository contains a combination of C++ codes I wrote while learning it at University. The purpose of those codes were to study and get acquainted with the C++ language. The variable names and comments were translated from portuguese to english.

* The folder "Composition" contains a project with the classes "Point", "Circle" and "Cylinder" and is an example of composition in C++;
* The folder "Fraction" contains a project with the class "Fraction" and contains multiples examples of operator overloading used to realize arithmetic operations with fractions;
* The folder "Vector" is an example of template usage in C++;
* The file "File.cpp" shows the code for opening, reading, writing and closing a file;
* "Time.cpp" is a file that shows the basics of creating a class in C++;
* "Unary_operator_overloading.cpp" is a file that shows an example of unary operator overloading.
